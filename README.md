## How to run

Install the Gatsby CLI

```bash
npm i -g gatsby-cli
```

Install Yarn

[https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)

Install dependencies with Yarn

```bash
yarn
```

Run the `develop` command

```bash
gatsby develop
```

This will query the shopify api, optimize images, and launch a dev server!
Any style changes should live-reload.

## Notes

- alt text is _required_ for each image on shopify
